      <h2>Explore</h2>
      <p>Ever wondered what a neuroscience simulation looks like as it is running?  Interact with your simulations and inspect them in real-time, all from right here in your browser.

      <h2>Expand</h2>
      <p>The cloud is a big place.  By leveraging technologies like Google AppEngine and Compute Engine, BigBrain allows researchers to run simulations in a <a href="/tutorial">massively parallel</a> manner.  Run hundreds or thousands of copies of a simulator, each with its own unique parameter set.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoblock span4">
      <h2>Collaborate</h2>
      <p>BigBrain makes it easy to <a href="/usage#share">share</a> results and experiments with fellow researchers.  Imagine being able to follow a link in a scientific paper and instantly be able to reproduce the results.</p>

      <h2>Parallel Parameter Search</h2>
      <p>Researchers set the parameters for a given simulation, run the model for a period of time, and analyze the results.  If the results aren't what the researcher is expecting, the simulation is re-parameterized and repeated.</p>

          <h4>Cloud Parallelism</h4>
          <p>BigBrain turns this concept on its head by allowing multiple simulations to run in parallel.  Explore huge parameter spaces all at once and generate results in parallel in real time.</p>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>BigBrain is an open source project, built on open standards like Javascript, HTML5 and WebGL. Feel free to <a href="/download">download</a> the source code and try it yourself.  We designed BigBrain so that it can run on any cluster of computers and is not specific to any platform.  Want to run it on your local machine? Go head! Google's Cloud? Sure!
